/*
Chessboard
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline
characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space
or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size
= 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid
of the given width and height.

a = 8
b = " "
for(let i = 0; i<a; i++)
{
    str = ""
    for(let j = 0; j<a; j++)
    {
        str += b
        if(b == " ")
        {
            b = "#"
        }else{
            b = " "
        }
    }
    console.log(str)
